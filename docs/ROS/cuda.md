# Introduction to CUDA

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. It allows developers to use NVIDIA GPUs for general purpose processing (an approach known as GPGPU, General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units). CUDA provides a significant performance boost by leveraging the parallel processing power of GPUs, making it ideal for compute-intensive tasks such as scientific simulations, machine learning, and image processing.

With CUDA, developers can write programs in C, C++, and Fortran, and execute them on the GPU, taking advantage of its massive parallelism. The CUDA toolkit includes libraries, debugging and optimization tools, a compiler, and a runtime library to help developers create high-performance applications.

In summary, CUDA is a powerful tool for accelerating computational tasks by harnessing the power of NVIDIA GPUs, enabling faster and more efficient processing for a wide range of applications.


### Checking NVIDIA Driver Version

If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card, it's important to ensure that the correct driver is installed for optimal performance. Here are the steps to check the NVIDIA driver version on your Linux system:

1. **Check the NVIDIA Driver Version**:
    ```sh
    nvidia-smi
    ```
    This command displays the NVIDIA System Management Interface, which includes information about the installed driver version and the GPU.

2. **Check the Installed NVIDIA Packages**:
    ```sh
    dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia
    ```
    This command lists all installed NVIDIA packages, which can help you verify the driver and related software versions.

By using these commands, you can easily check the NVIDIA driver version and ensure that your system is configured correctly for ROS development with an NVIDIA GPU.
